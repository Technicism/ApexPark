# Apex Park

The main attraction of Apex Park is the off-road race track that features highly cambered turns. There is also a mud volcano, rock crawling sections, logging objective, roads and trails. This map is the first I have created and is relatively small but I hope you enjoy spending time racing around the track as I have.

## GitHub Upload and Archive

I originally uploaded Apex Park to the Oovee Games website but this website no longer seems to support hosting mods or has intermittent problems preventing it from being accessible from there. Therefore, I have uploaded it to GitHub which is only the second place it has been uploaded by me (Technicism). There are uploads on different websites but these were not performed by me, so I can only recommend **[downloading it here on GitHub](https://github.com/Technicism/ApexPark/releases)** now.

For reference the original Oovee Games page can be viewed on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180216183813/http://www.oovee.co.uk/forum/files/file/1497-apex-park/) but the map cannot be downloaded from there.

The SHA256 hash for the ZIP file is:
`D01088D1CA8317B4ECECD929D9F85301911283B5EE3C2F1DFB75FD3209ED9111`
